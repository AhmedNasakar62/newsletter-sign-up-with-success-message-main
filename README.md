### What I learned

I've been suffering from JavaScript phobia since i finished my JavaScript tutorials on YouTube. I started having doubt of not going to be able to implement what i've learnt through out my tutorial but everything changed when i had an epiphany of taking this exercise which made me realise how my capabilities with JavaScript have evolved and so proud of myself.

### Continued development

Right now my focus is to embark on learning Reactjs and Tailwind css.
